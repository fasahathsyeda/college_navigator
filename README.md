Introduction - College Navigator
Our team created a responsive map of accredited United Statesâ€™ colleges and universities.The website features interactive capabilities that allows users to utilize multiple drop down menus to filter selected search criteria. Users are able make a refined search of the different institutions by such fields as: 

  State or US region
  School type (public, private non-profit, private for profit, trade schools, graduate schools)
  Major or academic field of interest 
  School population 
  Class size (if available)
  Campus size
  Campus setting (urban, suburban, rural)
  Application number and acceptance rate
  Academic ranking (for top 650 schools only) 
  Sports conference or sporting division available at that school (basketball + football)
  Tuition cost, and potentially average student debt upon graduation
